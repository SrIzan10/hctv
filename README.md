# hackclub.tv

This is the source code for [hackclub.tv (hackclub.tv)](https://hackclub.tv), a livestreaming website for hackclubbers.

Development has been ongoing for a few months, and the site is now live! There are some half-baked features, but I'm all ears for feedback.

The development setup guide can be read at <https://docs.hackclub.tv/guides/dev/>
