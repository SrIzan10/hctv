# hackclub.tv

This is the source code for [hackclub.tv (hctv.srizan.dev)](https://hctv.srizan.dev), a livestreaming website for hackclubbers.

Development has been ongoing for a few months, and the site is now live! There are some half-baked features, but I'm all ears for feedback.

Join [#hctv](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08HGLXGXAB) on the HC Slack for discussion and updates!

## Features

- High quality video streaming (low latency coming soon)
- Chat with other viewers
- Multiaccount support (database schema laid out, UI not implemented)
