The chat system is powered by a websocket server. Please read the entire page before implementing anything, as there are some important notes.

## Connection and messages

The websocket server is located at `wss://hctv.srizan.dev/api/chat/ws/:username`, where `:username` is the channel you want to connect to.  
You'll need to provide authentication, which can be done by providing an `auth_session` cookie, just like the REST API.

Once connected, you must implement a subroutine in your code to send ping messages every 5 seconds. This is because of Cloudflare limitations.

Messages are sent and received in JSON format. The following message types are supported:
- `message`: a chat message.  
  - sent by client:  
    ```json
    {
      "type": "message",
      "content": "Hello, world!"
    }
    ```
  - received by client:  
    ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "id": "user_id",
        "username": "user_who_sent_message",
        "avatar": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/avatar.png"
      },
      "message": "Hello, world!",
    }
    ```
- `ping`: a ping message to keep the connection alive.  
  - sent by client:  
    ```json
    {
      "type": "ping"
    }
    ```
  - received by client:  
    ```json
    {
      "type": "ping"
    }
    ```
- `history`: a message containing the chat history. This is sent upon connection.  
  - received by client:  
    ```json
    {
      "type": "history",
      "messages": [
        {
          "user": {
            "id": "user_id",
            "username": "user_who_sent_message",
            "avatar": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/avatar.png"
          },
          "message": "Hello, world!",
          "type": "message",
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```
## Emoji handling

    subgraph "Emoji Processing Pipeline"
        CHAT_MSG["Chat Message"]
        PATTERN_MATCH["Regex :emoji: Pattern"]
        EMOJI_REQUEST["emojiMsg WebSocket"]
        REDIS_LOOKUP["Redis HGET emojis"]
        FUZZY_SEARCH["uFuzzy"]
        EMOJI_RESPONSE["emojiMsgResponse"]
    end

    subgraph "Redis Storage"
        EMOJI_HASH["emojis hash key"]
        EMOJI_PREFIXED["emoji:{name} url"]
        EMOJIS_PREFIXED["emojis:{name} url"]
    end

    CHAT_MSG --> PATTERN_MATCH
    PATTERN_MATCH --":emojiname:"--> EMOJI_REQUEST
    EMOJI_REQUEST --> REDIS_LOOKUP

    REDIS_LOOKUP --> EMOJI_HASH
    REDIS_LOOKUP --> EMOJI_PREFIXED
    REDIS_LOOKUP --> EMOJIS_PREFIXED

    REDIS_LOOKUP --> EMOJI_RESPONSE

    FUZZY_SEARCH --> EMOJI_HASH
    FUZZY_SEARCH --"search results"--> EMOJI_RESPONSE
```

When a chat message is sent, the server looks for patterns in the format `:emojiname:` using regex. For each match, it sends a request to the `emojiMsg` WebSocket.  
The server then checks Redis for the emoji URL and returns it.

When a user wants to look up an emoji (by typing `:(partial name)`), the server uses uFuzzy to find matching emojis in the Redis `emojis` hash key and returns the results.

Here's what gets sent on the websocket:
- `emojiMsg`: Looks up emojis
  - sent by client:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "emojiMsg",
      "emojis": ["aga", "yapa", "heavysob", "yay", "yay-bounce"]
    }
    ```
  - received by client:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "emojiMsgResponse",
      "emojis": {
        // rough example of urls
        "aga": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/aga.png",
        "yapa": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/yapa.png",
        "heavysob": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/heavysob.png",
        "yay": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/yay.png",
        "yay-bounce": "https://emoji.slack-edge.com/yay-bounce.png"
      }
    }
    ```
- `emojiSearch`: Searches for emojis
  - sent by client:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "emojiSearch",
      "searchTerm": "aga"
    }
    ```
  - received by client:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "emojiSearchResponse",
      "results": [
        // real results btw
        "aga",
        "aga-brick-throw",
        "aga-dance",
        "aga-transparent",
        "a-aga",
        "a-aga-transparent",
        "agaban",
        "agaboing",
        "agabounce",
        "agabusiness"
      ]
    }
    ```
