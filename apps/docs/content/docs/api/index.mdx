description: Documented API endpoints for hackclub.tv
---

hctv is meant to be one of the most hackable streaming platforms out there. to that end, we have a (currently limited) public API that you can use to interact with the platform.

since this is beta software, the API is subject to change. additionally, many endpoints are yet not implemented. please send a message in #hctv on the Hack Club Slack if you have any requests.

## Base url

base url for all endpoints is `https://hctv.srizan.dev/api`.

## Authentication

most endpoints require authentication. this will be pointed out in the documentation.  
for now, it is done via a cookie called `auth_session` (as per lucia auth). this will change in the future as bot accounts are planned.

you'll need your user account to authenticate. as a recommendation, open an incognito window, log in to hctv, and copy the `auth_session` cookie from there.
